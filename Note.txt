component decorator
==================

Decorators or annotations are used to provide metadata about the entity where these decorators are added. Angular @Component decorator provides metadata about the class and tells Angular that the decorated class is a Component class.

Angular @Component provides configuration metadata that determines how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime.

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
 ...
 ...

*As you can see selector property here specifies value as ‘app-root’ which means any <app-root></app-root> tags that are used within a template will be compiled using the AppComponent class and get the functionality as defined in the class.

*templateUrl is specified as ./app.component.html which means view template is loaded from the file app.component.html in the current directory.

*Using styleUrls you can specify One or more relative paths or absolute URLs for files containing CSS stylesheets to use in this component. Here ./app.component.css is specified as css file which means styling for the component is done using hello-world.component.css in the current directory. By specifying style fields like this you can associate a specific css file to a component.
